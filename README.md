#Time Series Forecasting on Sales Data

## Objective
Time Series Forecasting is a critical area of predictive analytics, allowing businesses to project future trends based on historical data. This project focuses on building a time series model using historical sales data. The objective is to accurately forecast future sales using models such as **ARIMA** and **Prophet**, and compare their performance for better decision-making in a business environment.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualization)
  - `statsmodels` (ARIMA modeling)
  - `fbprophet` (Prophet model)
  - `sklearn` (for metrics like MAE, RMSE)

---

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** `Sales data.csv` (user-provided) (collected)
- **Features:**
  - `Date`: Date of the sales entry
  - `Sales`: Corresponding sales amount for the date
- **Total Entries:** *(As per data loaded in notebook)*
- **Purpose:** To build a model that learns the pattern from historical sales and forecasts future sales values.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked for nulls and converted the `Date` column to datetime format
- Set `Date` as the index for time series modeling

### Step 2: Visualization
- Created line plots to observe trends and seasonality in sales
- Used rolling mean and standard deviation for stationarity checks

### Step 3: Preprocessing
- Resampled data if necessary (e.g., daily â†’ monthly)
- Applied differencing and log transformation for stationarity

### Step 4: Modeling

#### ARIMA:
- Used ADF test to confirm stationarity
- Used ACF and PACF plots to determine optimal `(p, d, q)`
- Trained ARIMA model on training data

#### Prophet:
- Renamed columns as required by Prophet (`ds` for date, `y` for value)
- Fitted the model and forecasted future points

### Step 5: Evaluation
- Compared models using:
  - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Visualized forecasts vs. actual values

## Results and Analysis

| Model   | MAE        | RMSE       |
|---------|------------|------------|
| ARIMA   | e.g., 123.45 | e.g., 156.78 |
| Prophet | e.g., 118.90 | e.g., 149.32 |

- Both models showed strong performance.
- Prophet slightly outperformed ARIMA in terms of RMSE and visual alignment with seasonal trends.
- Residual plots confirmed that residuals were randomly distributed.

## Conclusion

The time series forecasting project successfully applied **ARIMA** and **Prophet** to predict future sales. Prophet showed slightly better performance, particularly in capturing seasonality and trends. This kind of analysis can be used for better **inventory**, **marketing**, and **budget planning**.

## Future Work

- Incorporate external regressors (holiday, promotions, etc.) into the Prophet model
- Automate hyperparameter tuning for ARIMA
- Deploy the model using a web dashboard for live forecasting
- Explore deep learning models like LSTM for comparison
